	Fixed documentation of the 'deletePrefix' function: if the given key is not
	a prefix of any key, an empty, not unchanged, map/set is returned. Thanks to
	Brian Bloniarz for the bug report.

2010-09-09, 0.3:
   Fixed strictness of the strict versions of the following non-Patricia
   functions: insert, adjust, alter, union, difference, intersection,
   mapInKeys; as well as the Patricia versions of insert and adjust. Thanks to
   Brian Bloniarz for the bug report.

   Applied the static argument transformation throughout, improving
   performance.

   Dropped support for containers < 0.3; GHC 6.12 has been out long enough, and
   support for older versions is too crippled to make it worthwhile.

2010-04-06, 0.2:
	Dependency update, nothing more.

2009-07-05, 0.1:
	All tries are now instances of Binary, thanks to Gregory Crosswhite. Adds a
	dependency on the 'binary' library as well as the following two methods to
	the Map class in Base.Map:

		serializeToList     :: m k a -> [(k,a)]
		deserializeFromList :: [(k,a)] -> m k a

2009-04-21, 0.0:
	Initial release.
